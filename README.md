## Dependencies
The project is implemented mainly as a series of Jupyter Notebooks. 
Running the simulation experiments requires the [myGym toolbox](https://github.com/incognite-lab/myGym/tree/master) of version 3.7. 
The neural models are implemented in Keras 2 with Tensorflow back-end.

The myGym toolbox must be built from the source as per the [instructions](https://github.com/incognite-lab/myGym/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
Other dependencies can be installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
